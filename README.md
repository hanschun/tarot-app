# tarot-app
A quick React app to display and manipulate tarot cards.
Uses the [tarot-cards](https://github.com/hanschun/tarot-cards) library that I developed to practice iteration over Javascript Maps.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
